Description

Preprocessing
The features used for the Ridge and the SVM classification are respectively normalized and scaled before performing the regression/classification. These preprocessing increase the performance of the algorithms.

Features
We used 2 type of features:
1) We extracted for each image X slices in the X-X direction. We computed an histogram for each slice, with 40 bins and used the frequencies as features. This generates 40*X = X features per image.
2) Yannick X for surface and perimeter

Model
We implemented 2 models. The first model is a Ridge regression which runs 3 different times. Each output below 0 and above 1 is respectively truncated to 0 and 1. Thus, the output is a vector of dimension 3 that indicates the probability of belonging to each of the  binary classes. These 3 regressions have been optimized with a leave one out cross validation that we implemented and performed for each of them independently.
The second model is a binary SVM classification that runs 3 different times in order to determine the probability of belonging to each of the 3 binary classes. Again, we obtain as output a vector of dimension 3. These 3 classifications were optimized independently with 3 leave one out cross validation.
The final model takes into account these 2 models by simply summing their results. The final output is the sum of the 2 models and corresponds to the probability of belonging to each of the 3 binary classes.

Postprocessing
We assign the label following the probability of belonging to the given class by rounding the probability (<0.5 or >=0.5).
