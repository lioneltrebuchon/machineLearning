1) Programmation: We have written a ridge regression in excel, and don't find the same values as in the python script.

2) Is it worth it taking MANY features, so having a QUANTITATIVE approach instead of a QUALITATIVE approach?

3) Programmation: code not sending alpha

4) Are the regressions to be trusted to weight features by themselves?

5) Report?
